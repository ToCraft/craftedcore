# CraftedCore

This mod is my basic library mod, so my mods would work across mod loader, and it won't take me that long to port my
mods.

## Legal Note

This mod is massively inspired by Architectury API and integrates the Mixin Trace mod by comp500, which is licensed
under MIT.
Everything not licensed under LGPL-3.0 is marked as such.

## How to use?

Use the following maven:

```Groovy
maven {
    name "tocraftMavenPublic"
    url "https://maven.tocraft.dev/public"
}
```

And the following mod-dependency:

```Groovy
modApi "dev.tocraft:craftedcore:${minecraft_version}-${craftedcore_version}"
```

#### e.g. for fabric and forge projects, which use a common-project:

common:

```Groovy
modApi "dev.tocraft:craftedcore:1.20.2-2.0"
```

fabric:

```Groovy
modApi "dev.tocraft:craftedcore-fabric:1.20.2-2.0"
